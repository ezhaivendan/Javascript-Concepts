### What is JavaScript?
<p>
JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages.

### Advantages of JavaScript
<ul><li><b>Less server interaction</b> − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server.

<li><b>Immediate feedback to the visitors</b> − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.

<li><b>Increased interactivity</b> − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.

<li><b>Richer interfaces</b> − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.</li></ul>
